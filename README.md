## Overview

This React-based application provides a platform for food providers and associations to coordinate and streamline the process of food donation and distribution. Associations can upload information about the food they need, including the type, quantity, and desired delivery date. On the other hand, food providers can search and offer available donations by uploading information about the food they have available, including the type, quantity, and expiration date.

The application simplifies the process of food donation and distribution by connecting those who have surplus food with those who need it. This reduces food waste and helps those in need by making it easier to donate and distribute surplus food.

The platform provides an easy-to-use interface for both food providers and associations. Food providers can quickly upload information about the food they have available and search for associations in need. Associations can easily upload information about the food they need and browse available donations.

Overall, this project is designed to help address the problem of food waste and food insecurity by providing a platform for efficient coordination between food providers and associations.
